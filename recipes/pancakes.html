    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>These 3-ingredient pancakes are so tasty! They're light and fluffy and super easy to make - my new favorite way to make simple and quick pancakes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine eggs, cottage cheese, and flour in a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with nonstick spray. Drop 3-tablespoon portions of batter onto
        the skillet. Cook until edges are set, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2
        minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with desired toppings, e.g. maple syrup, jam, fresh berries, or powdered sugar.</li>
