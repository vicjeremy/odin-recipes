    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This best ever meatloaf recipe lives up to its name and is my favorite I have found. Try it and you will see.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 slices bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded carrot</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground
        beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
